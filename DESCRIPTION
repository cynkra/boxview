Title: Display the Code of a Function in Nested Boxes
Version: 0.0.0.9000

    person("Antoine", "Fabri", , "antoine.fabri@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Functions containing a lot of control flow constructs can be hard
  to decipher. By displaying them into boxes and presenting the 'yes' and 'no'
  clauses of 'if' calls side by side we make their logic easier to grasp.
